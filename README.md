Scratchpad for some CC: Tweaked scripts I'm writing for a Minecraft playthrough.

Scripts are organized by major Minecraft version. Currently the only scripts are for CC: Tweaked running in MC 1.16.

Scripts can be downloaded in-game with `wget`. For example:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luketurner/computercraft-programs/main/1.16/stuffy.lua

stuffy
```

## Development

This is a personal repository. Feel free to use the programs, but I recommend **forking** the repo and using your forked versions. No PRs will be accepted and I offer **no commitments** about breaking changes, bugs, etc, etc.

For fun, I've been authoring this repo in the cloud with Github's Web editor. Push the `.` key when this repo is open in Github, or just visit: https://github.dev/luketurner/computercraft-programs.
